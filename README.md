This is a simple app I built using Underscore and Backbone Views that was done at the code along meetup at Dev Bootcamp on 5/5/14.

Here are some recommended links I'd recommend if you'd like to learn more about Backbone and Underscore:

FREE
* http://backbonetutorials.com/
* https://tutsplus.com/course/connected-to-the-backbone/ (only partially free)

NOT FREE
* https://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs
* https://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs-part-2


Hope this makes sense and helps you get your feet wet. Any feedback on the session bad or good can be sent to samprofessional@gmail.com.  Thanks.
